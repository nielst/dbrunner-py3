# dbrunner-py3

POC for finding differences over time in SQL results and raising those to segment.com

Configurations
--------------

Configuration for each job is stored in Dynamodb in the following format:
    
    {
      "id": "1",
      "query": "SELECT userid as id, firstname, lastname, total_quantity\nFROM   (SELECT buyerid, sum(qtysold) total_quantity\nFROM  sales\nGROUP BY buyerid\nORDER BY total_quantity desc limit 10) Q, users\nWHERE Q.buyerid = userid\nORDER BY Q.total_quantity desc",
      "warehouse": {
        "dbname": "",
        "host": "",
        "password": "",
        "port": "",
        "user": ""
      },
      "workplace": {
        "dbname": "",
        "host": "",
        "password": "",
        "port": "",
        "user": ""
      }
    }

The *query* will be executed against the *warehouse* and results stored in *workplace*. Use the *id* to run the job

The configurations are managed the following REST API:

GET /api/v1.0/configs

GET /api/v1.0/configs/{id}

POST /api/v1.0/configs

PUT /api/v1.0/configs/{id}

The API does not have authentication yet

How to run
--------------

POST to the following endpoint to run a stored configuration: Configuration id 1 is in working state

    POST: /run/{config_id}
    Content-Type: application/json
    Required payload: {}

The endpoint will synchronously do the following
- execute the query against the warehouse
- store the result in a new table in Postgressql
- compare the contents to the previous snapshot and find updated records
- if given a writekey, send an identify call to Segment for each updated record

        Payload: { "writekey": "123" }

Usually there will not be any changes, since the warehouse contains stale sample data.
However you can easily force a single record to update:

    Payload: { "force_change": "true" }

See the integration test for more details.
You can also make your own updates to the redshift warehouse, or connect to your own. (uh-oh, schema issues ahead?)


Unit & integration tests
--------------

Query and compare logic implemented in executed by Postgre. These unit tests requires postgres installed.

    #python3 -m "nose" -v
